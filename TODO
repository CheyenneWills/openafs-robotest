Goals for v0.5
--------------

* setup: [host:localhost] is confusing and inconsistent.
  - use [host:<hostname>] for all host sections?
  - this means the same file can be used on each host
* config: dafs vs fs
* install:
  - cope with /etc/hosts with loopback addresses for the hostname
  - helper for sudo -n setup (at least for debian?)


Post v0.5
---------

* tests:
  - implement or remove tests tagged as TODO
* install:
  - user vs global installs
* more packaging formats
  - debs
* client only test suite
  - assume servers already running on separate host(s)
* OpenAFSLibrary
  - new keywords
  - more complete unit tests
* Server setup and cell creation sans libafs.ko.
  Some options are:
  a. Ideally, a new util based on libafscp (afsutil?)
     to mount dirs and set acls (etc)
  b. Generate root vols, with cmu-dumpscan or refactor
     the volume dump stream code from OpenAFSLibrary
* config: per host command line args (options)
