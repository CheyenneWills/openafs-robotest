Goals for v0.5
--------------

* tests:
  - implement or remove tests tagged as TODO
* setup: [host:localhost] is confusing and inconsistent.
  - use [host:<hostname>] for all host sections?
  - this means the same file can be used on each host
* setup: afstuil install debs
* script: login --user option. I don't always need to be admin.
* more startup options in config file


Post v0.5
---------

* OpenAFSLibrary
  - new keywords
  - more complete unit tests
* Server setup and cell creation sans libafs.ko.
  Some options are:
  a. Ideally, a new util based on libafscp (afsutil?)
     to mount dirs and set acls (etc)
  b. Generate root vols, with cmu-dumpscan or refactor
     the volume dump stream code from OpenAFSLibrary
